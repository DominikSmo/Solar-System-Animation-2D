# Solar System Animation 2D
* This is a Solar System animation with ten objects(Sun and the nine planets).
* The sun is set as a central object.
* The Sun and all the planets rotate around its own axis and all the planets move in its orbits in the distance from the Sun.
* Each planet moves with concrete velocity in its orbit. There is also a timer for the animation.
*  When you click a button Start/Pause an animation will start or pause.
*  When you click 'W' an animation will be zoomed in or when you click 'S' an animation will be zoomed out.
*   I used Scene Builder to create the animation.
*   The animation is created in JavaFX and CSS(images of the plantes and an animation's background)
